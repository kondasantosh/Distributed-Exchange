Ethereum Distributed Token Exchange

This repository is inspired by the Ethereum Developer Masterclass: ICO and Token Exchange with Solidity course on Udemy. The Token-Exchange which I was inspired from can be tested with MetaMask and the Rinkeby Test-Net under https://tomw1808.github.io/distributed_exchange_truffle_class_3/index.html

Output
![output](Output2.gif)

The Exchange Smart-Contract has 3 functions:

1.Funding: It's possible to deposit and withdraw both tokens of any kind and Ether
2.Trading: You can trade any kind of token against ether. Both market orders and limit orders. It's also possible to cancel an order.
3.Manangement: It's possible to add new tokens on the fly.
The Exchange is unit tested with Truffle's Test-Framework.

All of this is also shown in the Course!


Necessary Software
In order to work with the smart contracts and for the course you need

1.the Node Package Manager
2.Truffle,React and state management tool like redux,recoil etc
3.Chai and mocha
4.MetaMask
5.The Chome-Browser
On windows eventually the Git-Bash



Knowlegde prior this course
1.Read "Solidity in Depth" and "Solidity Examples" from the Solidity docs
2.Know what is a list and a linked list. A short intro will be given, but our DataStructures use linked lists.
